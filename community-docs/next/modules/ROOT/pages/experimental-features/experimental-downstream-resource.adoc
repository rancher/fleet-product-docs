= Automatically copying resources to downstream clusters
:revdate: 2025-11-04

[WARNING]
====
This is an experimental feature.
====

From {product_name} v0.14.0 onwards, {product_name} supports propagating external resources to downstream clusters.

This simplifies dealing with dependencies of charts, such as values coming from external resources.
See also xref:/explanations/gitrepo-content.adoc#_using_valuesfrom[valuesFrom].

== How it works

HelmOps support a new `downstreamResources` field, which can be used to reference resources by kind and name.
Those resources must:

* Be either secrets or config maps. No other `kind`s are currently supported.
* Exist before being referenced from the HelmOp, and live in the same namespace as the HelmOp referencing them.

Example:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: fleet.cattle.io/v1alpha1
kind: HelmOp
[...] # metadata
spec:
  helm:
    [...] # Helm options
  downstreamResources:
    - kind: Secret
      name: my-secret
    - kind: ConfigMap
      name: my-config
----

This instructs the Fleet controller to copy those resources to each targeted downstream cluster, before deploying the
workload (in this case specified through a Helm chart) to said downstream cluster.

When a cluster is not targeted anymore, the Fleet agent will delete those resources from the cluster as well. They will
remain on the upstream cluster, though.

[NOTE]
====
If resources referenced through `downstreamResources` should stay on downstream clusters even after they are no longer targeted, xref:/reference/ref-bundle.adoc[keepResources] should be set to `true` on the HelmOp.

== Monitoring

From version v0.14.0 onwards, {product_name} monitors changes made to secrets and configmaps that are listed in `DownstreamResources`. It also checks whether a secret or configmap was created after the Bundle was created.

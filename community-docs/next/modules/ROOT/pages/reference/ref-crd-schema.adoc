This table summarizes the Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) used in *{product_name}*, including their purpose and top-level schema properties. Each CRD defines how {product_name} manages applications, deployments, and cluster configurations.

[cols="1,4,2,2", options="header"]
|===
| CRD | Description | Top-level Properties | Reference

| *Bundle v1alpha1*
| Bundle contains the resources of an application and its deployment options. It is deployed as a Helm chart to target clusters. When a GitRepo is scanned, it produces one or more bundles. Bundles are collections of resources deployed to one or more clusters and represent the fundamental deployment unit used in {product_name}. The contents of a Bundle may include Kubernetes manifests, Kustomize configuration, or Helm charts. Regardless of the source, the contents are dynamically rendered into a Helm chart by the agent and installed into the downstream cluster as a Helm release.

| link:reference/crds/bundle_v1alpha1.json[Bundle v1alpha1]

| *BundleDeployment v1alpha1*
| BundleDeployment is used internally by {product_name} and should not be used directly. When a Bundle is deployed to a cluster, an instance of a Bundle is called a BundleDeployment. It represents the state of that Bundle on a specific cluster with cluster-specific customizations. The Fleet agent is aware only of BundleDeployment resources created for the cluster it manages.

| link:reference/crds/bundledeployment_v1alpha1.json[BundleDeployment v1alpha1]

| *BundleNamespaceMapping v1alpha1*
| BundleNamespaceMapping maps bundles to clusters in other namespaces.
| `apiVersion, bundleSelector, kind, metadata, namespaceSelector`
| link:reference/crds/bundlenamespacemapping_v1alpha1.json[BundleNamespaceMapping v1alpha1]

| *Cluster v1alpha1*
| Cluster corresponds to a Kubernetes cluster. {product_name} deploys bundles to targeted clusters, referred to as downstream clusters. In a single-cluster deployment, the Fleet cluster acts as both manager and downstream cluster.
| `apiVersion, kind, metadata, spec, status`
| link:reference/crds/cluster_v1alpha1.json[Cluster v1alpha1]

| *ClusterGroup v1alpha1*
| ClusterGroup is a reusable selector used to target a group of clusters.
| `apiVersion, kind, metadata, spec, status`
| link:reference/crds/clustergroup_v1alpha1.json[ClusterGroup v1alpha1]

| *ClusterRegistration v1alpha1*
| ClusterRegistration is used internally by {product_name} and should not be used directly.
| `apiVersion, kind, metadata, spec, status`
| link:reference/crds/clusterregistration_v1alpha1.json[ClusterRegistration v1alpha1]

| *ClusterRegistrationToken v1alpha1*
| ClusterRegistrationToken is used by agents to register a new cluster.
| `apiVersion, kind, metadata, spec, status`
| link:reference/crds/clusterregistrationtoken_v1alpha1.json[ClusterRegistrationToken v1alpha1]

| *Content v1alpha1*
| Content is used internally by {product_name} and should not be used directly. It contains the resources from a bundle for a specific target cluster.
| `apiVersion, content, kind, metadata, sha256sum`
| link:reference/crds/content_v1alpha1.json[Content v1alpha1]

| *GitRepo v1alpha1*
| GitRepo describes a Git repository watched by {product_name}. The resource contains the necessary information to deploy the repository, or parts of it, to target clusters.
| `apiVersion, kind, metadata, spec, status`
| link:reference/crds/gitreporestriction_v1alpha1.json[GitRepo v1alpha1]

| *GitRepoRestriction v1alpha1*
| GitRepoRestriction optionally restricts GitRepo options within the same namespace.
| `allowedClientSecretNames, allowedRepoPatterns, allowedServiceAccounts, allowedTargetNamespaces, apiVersion, defaultClientSecretName, defaultServiceAccount, kind, metadata`
| link:reference/crds/gitreporestriction_v1alpha1.json[GitRepoRestriction v1alpha1]

| *HelmOp v1alpha1*
| HelmOp describes Helm chart information required to deploy a chart to target clusters.
| `apiVersion, kind, metadata, spec, status`
| link:reference/crds/helmop_v1alpha1.json[HelmOp v1alpha1]

| *ImageScan v1alpha1*
| JSON schema for ImageScan (v1alpha1) in group `fleet.cattle.io`.
| `apiVersion, kind, metadata, spec, status`
| link:reference/crds/imagescan_v1alpha1.json[ImageScan v1alpha1]

| *Schedule v1alpha1*
| Schedule represents a deployment schedule that determines when deployments are allowed or restricted.
| `apiVersion, kind, metadata, spec, status`
| link:reference/crds/schedule_v1alpha1.json[Schedule v1alpha1]

{product_name} creates bundles from a git repository. This happens either explicitly by specifying paths, or when a `fleet.yaml` is found.

The folder could contain a Helm chart, or reference one. It could be a plain Kubernetes manifest, or a Kustomize folder. Each bundle is converted to a single Helm chart for deployment.

The `fleet.yaml` file contains all the options for the deployment.

== Bundle Names

By default, bundle names will also be generated from the GitRepo's name and the path from which the bundle is created. However, a bundle's name can be overridden by using the `name` field in a `fleet.yaml` file.

Bundle lifecycles are tracked between releases by the Helm `releaseName` field added to each bundle. If the releaseName is not specified within `fleet.yaml` it is generated from `GitRepo.name + path`. Long names are truncated and a `-<hash>` prefix is added.

== How Repositories Are Scanned

**The Git repository has no required structure.** All scanned resources are stored as Kubernetes resources, so ensure scanned directories do not contain large files. Currently, resources must **gzip to less than 1 MB**.

Multiple paths can be defined for a `GitRepo`. Each path is scanned independently and becomes a managed xref:explanations/concepts.adoc[bundle] that {product_name} deploys and monitors.

{product_name} looks for the following files to determine deployment behavior:

[cols="1,2,3", options="header"]
|===
| File
| Location
| Meaning

| Chart.yaml
| Relative to `path` or custom path from `fleet.yaml`
| The resources are deployed as a Helm chart. Refer to the `fleet.yaml` for more options.

| kustomization.yaml
| Relative to `path` or custom path from `fleet.yaml`
| The resources are deployed using Kustomize. Refer to the `fleet.yaml` for more options.

| fleet.yaml
| Any subpath
| If any `fleet.yaml` is found, a new xref:explanations/concepts.adoc[bundle] is defined. This allows mixing charts, Kustomize, and raw YAML in the same repository.

| \.yaml
| Any subpath
| If a `Chart.yaml` or `kustomization.yaml` isn’t found, any `.yaml` or `.yml` file is assumed to be a Kubernetes resource and is deployed.

| overlays/\{name}
| Relative to `path`
| When deploying using raw YAML (not Kustomize or Helm), `overlays` is a special directory for customizations.
|===

=== Alternative Scan: Explicitly Defined by the User

{product_name} also supports a user-driven method for defining Bundles directly.

In this mode, {product_name} loads resources from a specified base directory.  
It looks for a `fleet.yaml` at the root only if an options file isn’t provided.  
This method is **non-recursive** and loads only explicitly defined Bundles.

==== Example Directory Structure

[source,console]
----
driven/
├── helm/
│   └── fleet.yaml
├── simple/
│   ├── configmap.yaml
│   └── service.yaml
└── kustomize/
    ├── base/
    │   ├── kustomization.yaml
    │   └── secret.yaml
    ├── overlays/
    │   ├── dev/
    │   │   ├── kustomization.yaml
    │   │   └── secret.yaml
    │   ├── prod/
    │   │   ├── kustomization.yaml
    │   │   └── secret.yaml
    │   └── test/
    │       ├── kustomization.yaml
    │       └── secret.yaml
    ├── dev.yaml
    ├── prod.yaml
    └── test.yaml

==== Corresponding GitRepo Definition

[source,yaml]
----
kind: GitRepo
apiVersion: fleet.cattle.io/v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: driven
  namespace: fleet-local
spec:
  repo: https://github.com/0xavi0/fleet-test-data
  branch: driven-scan-example
  bundles:
    - base: driven/helm
    - base: driven/simple
    - base: driven/kustomize
      options: dev.yaml
    - base: driven/kustomize
      options: test.yaml
----

In this example:

* `driven/helm`: contains a `fleet.yaml` that configures the Bundle.  
* `driven/simple`: contains only manifests; {product_name} packages all resources by default.  
* `driven/kustomize`: reused for multiple environments using different options files (`dev.yaml`, `test.yaml`).

Example options file for `driven/kustomize`:

[source,yaml]
----
namespace: kustomize-dev
kustomize:
  dir: "overlays/dev"
----

All paths must be relative to the base directory.  
If `base: driven/kustomize`, paths in options files are relative to `driven/kustomize`.

Incorrect:
[source,yaml]
----
namespace: kustomize-dev
kustomize:
  dir: "."
----

Correct:
[source,yaml]
----
namespace: kustomize-dev
kustomize:
  dir: "overlays/dev"
----

This approach simplifies working with Kustomize and provides finer control compared to recursive scanning.

== Excluding Files and Directories

{product_name} supports `.fleetignore` files, similar to `.gitignore`, to exclude files and directories.

* Uses Go’s [`filepath.Match`](https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Match) syntax.  
* Supports comments (`#`), escaped characters, and multiple `.fleetignore` files.  
* Applies recursively under each `.fleetignore` directory.

Example:

[source,console]
----
root/
├── .fleetignore            # contains `ignore-always.yaml`
├── something.yaml
├── bar/
│   ├── .fleetignore        # contains `something.yaml`
│   ├── ignore-always.yaml
│   ├── something2.yaml
│   └── something.yaml
└── foo/
    ├── ignore-always.yaml
    └── something.yaml
----

Unsupported:
* `**` wildcards
* Explicit inclusions (`!`)

== The `fleet.yaml` File

`fleet.yaml` modifies how resources are deployed and customized.  
It’s located at the root relative to the `GitRepo.path`.  
If found in a subdirectory, it defines a new xref:explanations/concepts.adoc[bundle] configured independently.

[NOTE]
====
Helm chart dependencies  
{product_name} automatically updates Helm chart dependencies unless `disableDependencyUpdate: true` is set.  
If disabled, manually update dependencies using:

* `helm dependencies update $chart`  
* `helm dependencies build $chart`
====

For field details, see xref:reference/ref-fleet-yaml.adoc[{product_name} YAML Reference].   
For private Helm repositories, see xref:how-tos-for-users/gitrepo-add.adoc#_using_private_helm_repositories[Using Private Helm Repositories].

== Using Helm Values

When applying changes to `values.yaml`:

* The latest changes override previous ones.
* Merge order: `helm.values` → `helm.valuesFiles` → `helm.valuesFrom`.

image::FleetValuesStages.svg[Static, 600]

Values can be templated with data from `clusters.fleet.cattle.io`.  
To disable templating, set `disablePreProcess` in `fleet.yaml`.

[NOTE]
====
If charts generate credentials or certificates, override these values to prevent redeployment loops.

Secrets loaded from downstream clusters using `valuesFrom` are encrypted if [data encryption](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/) is enabled.  
However, credentials stored in Git (`values:` or `valuesFiles:`) are not.
====

== Using `valuesFrom`

Example ConfigMap:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: configmap-values
  namespace: default
data:
  values.yaml: |-
    replicas: 2
    serviceType: NodePort
----

Example Secret:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: secret-values
  namespace: default
stringData:
  values.yaml: |-
    replicas: 3
    serviceType: NodePort
----

Create the secret:
[source,console]
----
kubectl create secret generic secret-values --from-file=values.yaml=secretdata.yaml
----

Reference them in `fleet.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
----
helm:
  chart: simple-chart
  valuesFrom:
    - secretKeyRef:
        name: secret-values
        namespace: default
        key: values.yaml
    - configMapKeyRef:
        name: configmap-values
        namespace: default
        key: values.yaml
  values:
    replicas: "4"
----

== Per-Cluster Customization

{product_name} customizes resources per cluster using `targetCustomizations` in `fleet.yaml`.

Cluster matching uses any combination of:

* `clusterSelector`
* `clusterGroupSelector`
* `clusterGroup`

Example:

[source,yaml]
----
targetCustomizations:
  - name: all
    clusterSelector: {}
  - name: none
    clusterSelector: null
----

To match a specific cluster, use the `clusters.fleet.cattle.io` resource name.

[source,yaml]
----
targetCustomizations:
  - name: prod
    clusterName: fleetname
----

See xref:how-tos-for-users/gitrepo-targets.adoc#_customization_per_cluster[Customization per Cluster] for details.

== Raw YAML Customization

When using raw YAML instead of Helm or Kustomize, you can apply overlays via the `overlays/` directory.

[source,console]
----
deployment.yaml
svc.yaml
overlays/custom/configmap.yaml         # added
overlays/custom/svc.yaml               # replaces svc.yaml
overlays/custom/deployment_patch.yaml  # patches deployment.yaml
----

Files ending in `_patch.` (for example, `deployment_patch.yaml`) patch matching base files.  
Patching uses JSON Merge, Strategic Merge, or JSON Patch, depending on content.

== Cluster and Bundle State

See xref:reference/ref-status-fields.adoc[Cluster and Bundle State].

== Nested GitRepo CRs

{product_name} supports nested `GitRepo` resources repositories containing other `GitRepo` definitions.  
This allows complex GitOps setups or multi-level repository structures.

Example:  
https://github.com/rancher/fleet-examples/tree/master/single-cluster/multi-gitrepo[Multi-GitRepo Example].

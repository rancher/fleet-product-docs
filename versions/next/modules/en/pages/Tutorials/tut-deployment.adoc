= Creating a Deployment

To deploy workloads onto downstream clusters, first create a Git repo, then create a GitRepo resource and apply it.

This tutorial uses the https://github.com/rancher/fleet-examples[fleet-examples] repository.

[NOTE]
====
For more details on how to structure the repository and configure the deployment of each bundle see xref:Explanations/gitrepo-content.adoc[GitRepo Contents].
For more details on the options that are available per Git repository see xref:How-tos-for-Users/gitrepo-add.adoc[Adding a GitRepo].

== Single-Cluster Examples

All examples will deploy content to clusters with no per-cluster customizations. This is a good starting point to understand the basics of structuring Git repos for{product_name}.

[tabs,sync-group-id=examples]
====
Helm::
+
An example using Helm. We are deploying the https://github.com/rancher/fleet-examples/tree/master/single-cluster/helm[helm example] to the local cluster.
+
The repository contains a helm chart and an optional `fleet.yaml` to configure the deployment:
+
.fleet.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
namespace: fleet-helm-example

# Custom helm options
helm:
  # The release name to use. If empty a generated release name will be used
  releaseName: guestbook

  # The directory of the chart in the repo.  Also any valid go-getter supported
  # URL can be used there is specify where to download the chart from.
  # If repo below is set this value if the chart name in the repo
  chart: ""

  # An https to a valid Helm repository to download the chart from
  repo: ""

  # Used if repo is set to look up the version of the chart
  version: ""

  # Force recreate resource that can not be updated
  force: false

  # How long for helm to wait for the release to be active. If the value
  # is less that or equal to zero, we will not wait in Helm
  timeoutSeconds: 0

  # Custom values that will be passed as values.yaml to the installation
  values:
    replicas: 2

Helm Multi Chart::
+
An https://github.com/rancher/fleet-examples/blob/master/single-cluster/helm-multi-chart[example deploying multiple charts] from a single repo. This is similar to the previous example, but will deploy three helm charts from the sub folders, each configured by its own `fleet.yaml`.
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -n fleet-local -f - <<EOF
kind: GitRepo
apiVersion: fleet.cattle.io/v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: helm
spec:
  repo: https://github.com/rancher/fleet-examples
  paths:
  - single-cluster/helm-multi-chart
EOF
----

Helm & Kustomize::
+
An example using https://github.com/rancher/fleet-examples/blob/master/single-cluster/helm-kustomize[Kustomize to modify a third party Helm chart]. It will deploy the Kubernetes sample guestbook application as packaged as a Helm chart downloaded from a third party source and will modify the helm chart using Kustomize. The app will be deployed into the fleet-helm-kustomize-example namespace. 
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -n fleet-local -f - <<EOF
kind: GitRepo
apiVersion: fleet.cattle.io/v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: helm
spec:
  repo: https://github.com/rancher/fleet-examples
  paths:

EOF
----

Kustomize::
+
An https://github.com/rancher/fleet-examples/blob/master/single-cluster/kustomize[example using Kustomize]. 
+
Note that the `fleet.yaml` has a `kustomize:` key to specify the path to the required `kustomization.yaml`:
+
.fleet.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
kustomize:
  # To use a kustomization.yaml different from the one in the root folder
  dir: ""
----
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -n fleet-local -f - <<EOF

  repo: https://github.com/rancher/fleet-examples
  paths:
  - single-cluster/kustomize
EOF
----

Manifests::
+
An https://github.com/rancher/fleet-examples/tree/master/single-cluster/manifests[example using raw Kubernetes YAML].
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -n fleet-local -f - <<EOF

== Multi-Cluster Examples

The examples below will deploy a multi git repo to multiple clusters at once and configure the app differently for each target.

[tabs,sync-group-id=examples]
====
Helm::
+
An example using Helm. We are deploying the https://github.com/rancher/fleet-examples/tree/master/multi-cluster/helm[helm example] and customizing it per target cluster
+
The repository contains a helm chart and an optional `fleet.yaml` to configure the deployment. The `fleet.yaml` is used to configure different deployment options, depending on the cluster's labels:
+
.fleet.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
namespace: fleet-mc-helm-example
targetCustomizations:
- name: dev
  helm:
    values:
      replication: false
  clusterSelector:
    matchLabels:
      env: dev

- name: test
  helm:
    values:
      replicas: 3
  clusterSelector:
    matchLabels:
      env: test

- name: prod
  helm:
    values:
      serviceType: LoadBalancer
      replicas: 3
  clusterSelector:
    matchLabels:
      env: prod
----
+
To create the deployment, we apply the custom resource to the upstream cluster. The `fleet-default` namespace, by default, contains the downstream cluster resources. The chart will be deployed to all clusters in the fleet-default namespace, which have a labeled cluster resources that matches any entry under `targets:`.
+
.gitrepo.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
kind: GitRepo
apiVersion: fleet.cattle.io/v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: helm
  namespace: fleet-default
spec:
  repo: https://github.com/rancher/fleet-examples
  paths:
  - multi-cluster/helm
  targets:
  - name: dev
    clusterSelector:
      matchLabels:
        env: dev

  - name: test
    clusterSelector:
      matchLabels:
        env: test

  - name: prod
    clusterSelector:
      matchLabels:
        env: prod
----
+
By applying the gitrepo resource to the upstream cluster, fleet will start to monitor the repository and create deployments:
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -n fleet-default -f gitrepo.yaml
----

Helm External::
+
An https://github.com/rancher/fleet-examples/blob/master/multi-cluster/helm-external[example using a Helm chart that is downloaded from a third party source and customizing it per target cluster]. The customization is similar to the previous example.

Helm & Kustomize::
+
An example using https://github.com/rancher/fleet-examples/blob/master/multi-cluster/helm-kustomize[kustomize to modify a third party Helm chart]. It will deploy the Kubernetes sample guestbook application as packaged as a Helm chart downloaded from a third party source and will modify the helm chart using Kustomize. The app will be deployed into the fleet-helm-kustomize-example namespace. 
+
The application will be customized as follows per environment: 
+
  * Dev clusters: Only the redis leader is deployed and not the followers. 
  * Test clusters: Scale the front deployment to 3 
  * Prod clusters: Scale the front deployment to 3 and set the service type to LoadBalancer 
+
The `fleet.yaml` is used to control which overlays are used, depending on the cluster's labels:

.fleet.yaml
[source,yaml]

Kustomize::
+
An https://github.com/rancher/fleet-examples/blob/master/multi-cluster/kustomize[example using Kustomize] and customizing it per target cluster.

The customization in `fleet.yaml` is identical to the "Helm & Kustomize" example.

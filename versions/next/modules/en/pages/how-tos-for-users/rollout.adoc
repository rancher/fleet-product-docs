= Rollout Strategy

Fleet uses a rollout strategy to control how apps are deployed across clusters. You can define the order and grouping of cluster deployments using partitions, enabling controlled rollouts and safer updates.

Fleet evaluates the ++Ready++ status of each ++BundleDeployment++ to determine when to proceed to the next partition. For more information, refer to the xref:reference\ref-status-fields.adoc[Status fields].

During a rollout, the GitRepo status indicates deployment progress. This helps you understand when bundles become ++Ready++ before continuing:

* For initial deployments:
** One or more clusters may be in a ++NotReady++ state.
** Remaining clusters are marked as ++Pending++, meaning deployment has not started.
* For rollouts:
** One or more clusters may be in a ++NotReady++ state.
** Remaining clusters are marked ++OutOfSync++ until the deployment continues.

The rollout configuration options are documented in the ++rolloutStrategy++ field of the xref:reference\ref-fleet-yaml.adoc[++fleet.yaml++].

[NOTE]
====
If ++rolloutStrategy++ is not specified in ++fleet.yaml++, Fleet uses the default values.

== How Does Partitioning Work?

Partitions are solely used for grouping and controlling the rollout of ++BundleDeployments++ across clusters. They do not affect deployment options.

If targeted clusters are not part of a partition, they are not included in the rollout. If a cluster is part of a partition, it receives a ++BundleDeployment++ when the partition is processed.

Partitions are ++NotReady++ if they have clusters that exceed the allowed number of ++NotReady++ clusters. Offline clusters are considered ++NotReady++ until they come back online and deploy the ++BundleDeployment++ successfully.

Thresholds are controlled by:

* Manual partitions: Use ++maxUnavailable++ inside each partition. If unspecified, ++rolloutStrategy.maxUnavailable++ is used.
* Automatic partitions: Use ++rolloutStrategy.maxUnavailable++.

Fleet proceeds only if the number of ++NotReady++ partitions is less than ++maxUnavailablePartitions++.

[NOTE]
====
Fleet rolls out deployments in batches of up to 50 clusters per partition. After each batch, Fleet checks the ++maxUnavailable++ threshold. For example:

* For a partition with 25 clusters and ++maxUnavailable: 5++, Fleet deploys to all 25 and then checks.
* For a partition with 100 clusters, Fleet deploys to 50, checks, and then proceeds with the next 50.

Fleet rollout strategy options:

[cols="1,2,1",options="header"]
|===
| Field | Description | Default
| maxUnavailable | Max number or percentage of clusters that can be ++NotReady++. | 100%
| maxUnavailablePartitions | Max number or percentage of ++NotReady++ partitions. | 0
| autoPartitionSize | Number or percentage of clusters per auto-created partition. | 25%
| partitions | Define manual partitions by cluster labels or groups. | –
|===

=== Automatic Partitioning

Fleet automatically creates partitions using ++autoPartitionSize++. For 200 clusters with ++autoPartitionSize: 25%++, it creates 4 partitions of 50 clusters each.

Rollout proceeds in batches of 50 clusters, checking ++maxUnavailable++ before continuing.

=== Manual Partitioning

Manual partitions are defined with the ++partitions++ option. This gives control over cluster selection and rollout order.

[NOTE]
====
If you define ++partitions++, ++autoPartitionSize++ is ignored.
====

.Example
[source,yaml]
----

rolloutStrategy:
partitions:
- name: demoRollout
maxUnavailable: 10%
clusterSelector:
matchLabels:
env: staging
- name: stable
maxUnavailable: 5%
clusterSelector:
matchLabels:
env: prod
----

Fleet performs rollout as follows:

. Selects clusters using ++clusterSelector++, ++clusterGroup++, or ++clusterGroupSelector++.
. Starts rollout to the first partition.
. Waits for readiness.
. Proceeds to the next partition.

[NOTE]
====
# MaxNew is always 50. A bundle change stages up to 50 ++BundleDeployments++ at once.
====

[NOTE]
====
* Label clusters to assign them to specific partitions.
* Fleet processes partitions in the order they appear in the ++fleet.yaml++ file.
====

=== Single Partition

If ++rolloutStrategy.partitions++ is not defined:

* For <200 clusters: one partition.
* For ≥200 clusters: partitions based on ++autoPartitionSize++.

Example with 200 clusters and ++autoPartitionSize: 25%++:

. Rolls out to first 50.
. Evaluates readiness.
. Proceeds if conditions are met.

=== Multiple Partitions

If multiple partitions are defined, Fleet uses ++maxUnavailablePartitions++ to control rollout.

Rollout pauses if the number of ++NotReady++ partitions exceeds ++maxUnavailablePartitions++.

== Preventing Image Pull Storms

Each cluster pulls images during rollout. Hundreds of clusters pulling simultaneously can overload registries.

Use:

* ++autoPartitionSize++
* ++partitions++
* ++maxUnavailable++

Fleet uses readiness checks to control rollout pace.

.Example with 200 clusters (5 partitions of 40):

* ++maxUnavailablePartitions++: 0
* ++maxUnavailable++: 10%

Rollout proceeds:

. Deploys to 40 clusters.
. Checks readiness.
. If ≤4 clusters are ++NotReady++, proceed.
. Else, pause until condition is met.

Reduce cluster count per partition to slow rollout further.

== Use Cases and Behavior

If clusters don’t divide evenly, Fleet rounds down partition sizes.

Example: 230 clusters with ++autoPartitionSize: 25%++

* Four partitions of 57 clusters
* One partition of 2 clusters

=== Scenario: 50 Clusters

[source,yaml]
----
rolloutStrategy:
maxUnavailable: 10%
----

* One partition with all 50 clusters.
* All deployed at once, then readiness is evaluated.

image::deploy-50Clusters.png[50 clusters scenario]

=== Scenario: 100 Clusters

[source,yaml]
----
rolloutStrategy:
maxUnavailable: 10%
----

* One partition with all 100 clusters.
* Fleet deploys to 50, then evaluates readiness.
* Waits if 10 or more clusters are ++NotReady++.

=== Scenario: 200 Clusters (Auto)

[source,yaml]
----
rolloutStrategy:
maxUnavailablePartitions: 1
autoPartitionSize: 10%
----

* 10 partitions of 20 clusters.
* Fleet waits if 2 or more partitions are ++NotReady++.

=== Scenario: 200 Clusters (Manual)

[source,yaml]
----
rolloutStrategy:
maxUnavailable: 0
maxUnavailablePartitions: 0
partitions:
- name: demoRollout
clusterSelector:
matchLabels:
stage: demoRollout
- name: stable
clusterSelector:
matchLabels:
stage: stable
----

* Fleet rolls out to ++demoRollout++.
* Waits for readiness before moving to ++stable++.

== Rollout Strategy Defaults

Defaults:

* ++maxUnavailable++: 100%
* ++maxUnavailablePartitions++: 0

With 200 clusters and default config:

* Four partitions of 50 clusters
* All considered ++Ready++ immediately

Fleet recommends:

* Set ++maxUnavailable++: 10%
* Set ++maxUnavailablePartitions++: 0 or more

This ensures:

* Readiness checks before proceeding
* Paused rollout if too many partitions are ++NotReady++

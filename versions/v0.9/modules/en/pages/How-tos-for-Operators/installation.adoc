= Installation Details

The installation is broken up into two different use cases: single and multi-cluster.
The single cluster install is for if you wish to use GitOps to manage a single cluster, in which case you do not need a centralized manager cluster. In the multi-cluster use case you will setup a centralized manager cluster to which you can register clusters.

If you are just learning {product_name} the single cluster install is the recommended starting
point. After which you can move from single cluster to multi-cluster setup down the line.

Single-cluster is the default installation. The same cluster will run both the {product_name} manager and the {product_name} agent. The cluster will communicate with Git server to deploy resources to this local cluster. This is the simplest setup and very useful for dev/test and small scale setups. This use case is supported as a valid use case for production.

== Prerequisites

[tabs]
====
Helm 3::
+
{product_name} is distributed as a Helm chart. Helm 3 is a CLI, has no server side component, and is fairly straight forward. To install the Helm 3 CLI follow the https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install[official install instructions]. 

Kubernetes::
+
{product_name} is a controller running on a Kubernetes cluster so an existing cluster is required. For the single cluster use case you will install {product_name} to the cluster which you intend to manage with GitOps. Any Kubernetes community supported version of Kubernetes will work, in practice this means 1.20.5 or greater.
====

== Default Install

Install the following two Helm charts.

[tabs]
======
Install::
+
--
[CAUTION]
.{product_name} in Rancher
====
Rancher has separate helm charts for {product_name} and uses a different repository.
====

First add Fleet's Helm repository.

[,bash]
----
helm repo add fleet https://rancher.github.io/fleet-helm-charts/
----

Second install the {product_name} CustomResourcesDefintions.

[,bash]
----
helm -n cattle-fleet-system install --create-namespace --wait fleet-crd \\ fleet/fleet-crd
----

Third install the {product_name} controllers.

[,bash]
----
helm -n cattle-fleet-system install --create-namespace --wait fleet \\ fleet/fleet
----
--

Verify::
+
--
{product_name} should be ready to use now for single cluster. You can check the status of the {product_name} controller pods by running the below commands.
[,bash]
----
kubectl -n cattle-fleet-system logs -l app=fleet-controller kubectl -n cattle-fleet-system get pods -l app=fleet-controller
----
[,bash]
----
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE fleet-controller-64f49d756b-n57wq 1/1 Running 0 3m21s
----

======

You can now xref:how-tos-for-users/gitrepo-add.adoc[register some git repos] in the `fleet-local` namespace to start deploying Kubernetes resources.

== Configuration for Multi-Cluster

[CAUTION]
====
Downstream clusters in Rancher are automatically registered in{product_name}. Users can access {product_name} under `Continuous Delivery` on Rancher.

The multi-cluster install described below is *only* covered in standalone Fleet, which is untested by Rancher QA.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
The setup is the same as for a single cluster.
After installing the {product_name} manager, you will then need to register remote downstream clusters with the {product_name} manager.

However, to allow for xref:./cluster-registration#_manager_initiated[manager-initiated registration] of downstream clusters, a few extra settings are required. Without the API server URL and the CA, only xref:./cluster-registration#_agent_initiated[agent-initiated registration] of downstream clusters is possible.
====


=== API Server URL and CA certificate

In order for your {product_name} management installation to properly work it is important
the correct API server URL and CA certificates are configured properly.  The {product_name} agents
will communicate to the Kubernetes API server URL. This means the Kubernetes
API server must be accessible to the downstream clusters.  You will also need
to obtain the CA certificate of the API server. The easiest way to obtain this information
is typically from your kubeconfig file (`$HOME/.kube/config`). The `server`,
`certificate-authority-data`, or `certificate-authority` fields will have these values.

[,yaml]
----
title="$HOME/.kube/config"
apiVersion: v1
clusters:

* cluster:
  certificate-authority-data: LS0tLS1CRUdJTi...
  server: https://<EXAMPLE_URL>:6443
----

[discrete]
==== Extract CA certificate

Please note that the `certificate-authority-data` field is base64 encoded and will need to be
decoded before you save it into a file. This can be done by saving the base64 encoded contents to
a file and then running

[,shell]
----
base64 -d encoded-file > ca.pem
----

Next, retrieve the CA certificate from your kubeconfig.

[tabs]
====
Extract First::
+
--
If you have `jq` and `base64` available then this one-liners will pull all CA certificates from your `KUBECONFIG` and place then in a file named `ca.pem`.
[,shell]
----
kubectl config view -o json --raw | jq -r '.clusters[].cluster["certificate-authority-data"]' | base64 -d > ca.pem
----
--

Multiple Entries::
+
--
Or, if you have a multi-cluster setup, you can use this command: 
[,shell]
----
# replace CLUSTERNAME with the name of the cluster according to your KUBECONFIG
kubectl config view -o json --raw | jq -r '.clusters[] | select(.name=="CLUSTERNAME").cluster["certificate-authority-data"]' | base64 -d > ca.pem
----
--
====

[discrete]
==== Extract API Server

If you have a multi-cluster setup, you can use this command:

[,shell]
----
# replace CLUSTERNAME with the name of the cluster according to your KUBECONFIG
API_SERVER_URL=$(kubectl config view -o json --raw  | jq -r '.clusters[] | select(.name=="CLUSTER").cluster["server"]')
# Leave empty if your API server is signed by a well known CA
API_SERVER_CA="ca.pem"
----

[discrete]
==== Validate

First validate the server URL is correct.

[,shell]
----
curl -fLk "$API_SERVER_URL/version"
----

The output of this command should be JSON with the version of the Kubernetes server or a `401 Unauthorized` error.
If you do not get either of these results than please ensure you have the correct URL. The API server port is typically
6443 for Kubernetes.

Next validate that the CA certificate is proper by running the below command.  If your API server is signed by a
well known CA then omit the `--cacert "$API_SERVER_CA"` part of the command.

[,shell]
----
curl -fL --cacert "$API_SERVER_CA" "$API_SERVER_URL/version"
----

If you get a valid JSON response or an `401 Unauthorized` then it worked. The Unauthorized error is
only because the curl command is not setting proper credentials, but this validates that the TLS
connection work and the `ca.pem` is correct for this URL. If you get a `SSL certificate problem` then
the `ca.pem` is not correct. The contents of the `$API_SERVER_CA` file should look similar to the below:

[,pem]
.ca.pem

### Install for Multi-Cluster

In the following example it will be assumed the API server URL from the `KUBECONFIG` which is `https://example.com:6443`
and the CA certificate is in the file `ca.pem`. If your API server URL is signed by a well-known CA you can
omit the `apiServerCA` parameter below or just create an empty `ca.pem` file (ie `touch ca.pem`).

Setup the environment with your specific values, e.g.:

[,shell]
----
API_SERVER_URL="https://example.com:6443"
API_SERVER_CA="ca.pem"
----

Once you have validated the API server URL and API server CA parameters, install the following two
Helm charts.

[tabs]
====

----
helm -n cattle-fleet-system install --create-namespace --wait \\ fleet-crd`} {versions.next.fleetCRD}
----
Third install the {product_name} controllers.
[,bash]
----
helm -n cattle-fleet-system install --create-namespace --wait \\ --set apiServerURL="$API_SERVER_URL" \\ --set-file apiServerCA="$API_SERVER_CA" \\ fleet`} {versions.next.fleet}
----

Verify::
+

{product_name} should be ready to use. You can check the status of the {product_name} controller pods by running the below commands.
[,bash]
----
kubectl -n cattle-fleet-system logs -l app=fleet-controller kubectl -n cattle-fleet-system get pods -l app=fleet-controller
----
[,bash]
----
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE fleet-controller-64f49d756b-n57wq 1/1 Running 0 3m21s
----

At this point the {product_name} manager should be ready. You can now xref:how-tos-for-operators/cluster-registration.adoc[register clusters] and xref:how-tos-for-users/gitrepo-add.adoc#_create_gitrepo_instance[git repos] with
the {product_name} manager.

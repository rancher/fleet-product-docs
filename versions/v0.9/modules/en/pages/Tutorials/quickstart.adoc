Who needs documentation, lets just run this thing!

== Install

{product_name} is distributed as a Helm chart. Helm 3 is a CLI, has no server side component, and its use is fairly straightforward. To install the Helm 3 CLI follow the https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install[official install instructions].

[CAUTION]
.{product_name} in Rancher
====
Rancher has separate helm charts for {product_name} and uses a different repository.
====


[tabs]
====
Linux/Mac::
+
[source,bash]
----
brew install helm
helm repo add fleet https://rancher.github.io/fleet-helm-charts/
----

Windows::
+
[source,bash]
----
choco install kubernetes-helm
helm repo add fleet https://rancher.github.io/fleet-helm-charts/
----
====

Install the {product_name} Helm charts (there's two because we separate out CRDs for ultimate flexibility.)

[source,bash]
----
helm -n cattle-fleet-system install --create-namespace --wait fleet-crd \
    fleet/fleet-crd
helm -n cattle-fleet-system install --create-namespace --wait fleet \
    fleet/fleet
----

== Add a Git Repo to Watch

Change `spec.repo` to your git repo of choice.  Kubernetes manifest files that should
be deployed should be in `/manifests` in your repo.

[source,bash]
----
cat > example.yaml << "EOF"
apiVersion: fleet.cattle.io/v1alpha1
kind: GitRepo
metadata:
  name: sample
  # This namespace is special and auto-wired to deploy to the local cluster
  namespace: fleet-local
spec:
  # Everything from this repo will be run in this cluster. You trust me right?
  repo: "https://github.com/rancher/fleet-examples"
  paths:
  - simple
EOF

kubectl apply -f example.yaml
----

== Get Status

Get status of what fleet is doing

[source,shell]
----
kubectl -n fleet-local get fleet
----

You should see something like this get created in your cluster.

----
kubectl get deploy frontend
----

----
NAME       READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
frontend   3/3     3            3           116m
----

Enjoy and read the xref:index.adoc[docs].

:date: 2024-07-17 11:54:57 +0000 UTC

* (github-actions[bot]) released this 2024-07-17 11:54:57 +0000 UTC*

== Description

The Fleet v0.10 release brings significant changes, including a redesign that splits components into containers and switches to the controller-runtime framework. The rewritten controllers switch to structured logging. To reduce image size and complexity, v0.10 integrates the gitjob repository, merges various controller codes, and introduces new features such as sharding with node selectors, prometheus metrics, configurable leader election, and worker count for the fleet-controller. The release deprecates the "fleet test" command in favor of "`target`" and "`deploy`" with a dry-run option and adds experimental OCI content storage. Bug fixes enhance drift detection, cluster status reporting, and various operational aspects, while automation improvements bolster testing, CI, and the release workflow.
